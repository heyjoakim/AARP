# An Architecture Reconstruction Project (AARP)

The goal of the project is to recover one or more architectural views and to present them in a brief report. The audience of the report is somebody who has not seen that system before and needs to get a high-level understanding of the system.


Target: [The Zeeguu-API](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/Zeeguu-API)- Python backend.

**Viewpoints**

You choose which architecturally relevant viewpoints you want to include in your report.

- A module view is the simplest, and this is also why we focused the first two AR lectures on it. However, make sure to explain it well by describing the roles of both the modules and the dependencies in it (remember the discussion about “verbs and nouns” in Lecture 11). 
- If you decide to extract a reflexion model that’s cool. Ask one of the developers of your system for a hypothetical diagraviewm; or find one in the documentation and see whether the system conforms to it.
- A Polymetric viewpoint would also be great
- Other viewpoints would definitely be interesting to see. Do you have access to the deployment files (docker-compose.yml, dockerfile)? In general, as the Symphony paper argues in Section 5.2: “These viewpoints can come from a library of well-known viewpoints, or a new viewpoint can be created for a specific reconstruction”.
